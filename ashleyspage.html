      <h2>My career</h2>
          </p>

          <p>Business has always interested me as I started growing up. Throughout the years I would take notes about different topics of business so I could stabalize my future plans. Right now I'm planning on going for an associate degree for business administration. There are different courses that you need to take such as accounting, introduction to international business, principles to macroeconomics, etc. There are some courses that I would need to take out of school and through nova. Business wasn't always my first choice, being a lawyer was. I was also so interested in learning about all the laws and defending someone with evidence. I gave up on that dream because I felt like it wouldn't have been the best career path for myself. I have anxiety and get panic attacks when I'm put under pressure so being in a room where all the pressure is put on you to help your client, it wouldn't have been the best for me. </p>
